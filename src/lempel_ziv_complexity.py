"""Lempel-Ziv complexity for a binary sequence, in naive Python code.

- How to use it? From Python, it's easy:

>>> from lempel_ziv_complexity import lempel_ziv_complexity
Info: numba.jit seems to be available.
>>> s = '1001111011000010'
>>> lempel_ziv_complexity(s)  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010
6

- Note: there is also a Cython-powered version, for speedup, see :download:`lempel_ziv_complexity_cython.pyx`.

    """ Manual implementation of the Lempel-Ziv complexity.

    It is defined as the number of different substrings encountered as the stream is viewed from begining to the end.
    As an example:

    >>> s = '1001111011000010'
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity(s)  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010
    6

    Marking in the different substrings the sequence complexity :math:`\mathrm{Lempel-Ziv}(s) = 6`: :math:`s = 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010`.

    - See the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv_complexity for more details.


    Other examples:

    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1010101010101010')  # 1 / 0 / 10
    3
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1001111011000010000010')  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010 / 000 / 010
    7
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('100111101100001000001010')  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010 / 000 / 010 / 10
    8

    - Note: it is faster to give the sequence as a string of characters, like `'10001001'`, instead of a list or a numpy array.
