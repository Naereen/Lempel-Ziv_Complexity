"""Lempel-Ziv complexity for a binary sequence, in simple Cython code (C extension).

- How to build it? Simply use the file :download:`Makefile` provided in this folder.

- How to use it? From Python, it's easy:

>>> from lempel_ziv_complexity_cython import lempel_ziv_complexity
>>> s = '1001111011000010'
>>> lempel_ziv_complexity(s)  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010
6

- Requirements: you need to have [Cython](http://Cython.org/) installed, and use [CPython](https://www.Python.org/).

    """Lempel-Ziv complexity for a binary sequence, in simple Cython code (C extension).

    It is defined as the number of different substrings encountered as the stream is viewed from begining to the end.
    As an example:

    >>> s = '1001111011000010'
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity(s)  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010
    6

    Marking in the different substrings the sequence complexity :math:`\mathrm{Lempel-Ziv}(s) = 6`: :math:`s = 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010`.

    - See the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv_complexity for more details.


    Other examples:

    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1010101010101010')  # 1 / 0 / 10
    3
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('1001111011000010000010')  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010 / 000 / 010
    7
    >>> lempel_ziv_complexity('100111101100001000001010')  # 1 / 0 / 01 / 1110 / 1100 / 0010 / 000 / 010 / 10
    8

    - Note: it is faster to give the sequence as a string of characters, like `'10001001'`, instead of a list or a numpy array.

    - Note: there is also a naive Python version, for speedup, see :download:`lempel_ziv_complexity.py`.
